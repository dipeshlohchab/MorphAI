# 🎞️ Obscura AI

A full-stack deep learning web application for **bidirectional GAN-based image translation**.  
Transform real-world photos into artistic renderings, or convert artwork back into realistic photo-like images using a trained **CycleGAN** architecture.

The application features a cinematic darkroom-inspired interface, real-time image generation, drag-and-drop uploads, and downloadable outputs.

# 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses a **CycleGAN** consisting of:

## Generators
- `G_photo_to_art.keras`
  - Converts photos into artistic outputs

- `F_art_to_photo.keras`
  - Converts artwork back into realistic images

## Discriminators
- `Dx_photo.keras`
- `Dy_art.keras`

Discriminators are used only during training and are not required during deployment.
